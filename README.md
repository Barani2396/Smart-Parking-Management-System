# Smart-Parking-Management-System
Simulink model for a parking system

Description

The proposed model delivers information about available parking spaces. This in turn provide benefit to all 
drivers when they enter a parking facility. In addition, the parking gates and signal lights were synchronized to 
ease the entire process. Thus, this system helps to identify the number of car present as well as managing all 
physical entities in the confined parking facility.
